- Description: Density logging data contains substantial amounts of data, which can often be approximated to simplify processing and further calculations. This project develops an algorithm to approximate density logging data through iterative partitioning of the original dataset and minimizing the total variance.
- Technologies: numpy, pandas, matplotlib
