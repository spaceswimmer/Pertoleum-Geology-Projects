- Description: Capillary curves provide essential insights for petroleum engineers to understand the height of the oil-saturated and water-saturated parts of the reservoir, crucial for reservoir development. However, manual analysis of these curves consumes a significant amount of time. There exist approximation models that involve finding coefficients using optimization methods. This project involved approximating 42 capillary curves using various models and the least squares method.
- Technologies: scipy, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
