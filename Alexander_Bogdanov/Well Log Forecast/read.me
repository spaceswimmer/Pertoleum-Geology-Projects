Geophysical well surveys are a key source of data for predicting the oil and gas potential of subsurface formations and are often lacking in full due to significant economic costs. 
The task of supplementing missing well data is relevant in oil companies and can be addressed using machine learning methods.
This project focuses on forecasting well logs using gradient boosting techniques, particularly XGBoost. 
It explores the application of machine learning algorithms to predict well log data.
